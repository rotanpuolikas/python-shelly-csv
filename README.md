# Python Shelly tool collection

!!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!

This is a (soon to be) collection of all sorts of python tools that have something to do with a Shelly Plug S

Current things here:

### collect.py

This is just a thing that runs all the time forever, collecting one entry per second.
Currently this creates a csv file and fills it with unixtime;apower, so basically jsut current time and current wattage.
